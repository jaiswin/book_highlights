Children are not simply cute, they are powerful. If we limit their spiritual actions by labelling them “cute”, we are degrading the call that is on their lives. Instead we should prize, nurture and encourage their relationship with God. Sometimes creches are thought of and run simply as places to keep children occupied and expose them to a few Bible stories, while “real church” takes place elsewhere. But God, who has seen these children in the womb and known them before the foundations of the earth, is watching over them and is busy preparing them for their future. Even their times in the creche can and should be a key time in their spiritual lives where they experience God. Our creches are not meant to be glorified babysitting services where we look after the children so that the adults can get on with proper church. Instead they should be ministry arenas where God is allowed to meet with these little ones. As Jesus said in Matthew 19:14, we are to let the little ones come to Him without hindrance, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.

Endurance has little to do with feelings; it’s about hanging in there for no other reason than the conviction that what we’re doing is right. In a fickle culture, endurance is one thing that’s in short supply. How quickly we are tempted to toss friendships, marriages and even our church relationships aside because we’re not willing to put our heads down and work at maintaining them. To Timothy, Paul repeats the call to endure, and uses the analogy of the soldier as an example. No one deliberately places themselves on the battlefield: it’s the last place on earth we’d want to be. But duty, honour, bravery and faithfulness keep the soldier in place. Perhaps following Christ feels like hard work right now. Whatever the feelings, let’s press on.

In Thessalonica, the problem was not lack of teaching: it was lack of response. Paul was not just asking for action because he was speaking, but because he spoke in the name of Jesus. Perhaps it’s time for us to hear what the Lord is saying to us and respond to Him.

Rachel was 8 years old. She had been at our church for most of her life and had been looking forward to the day when she could become a leader. After some leadership training and a lot of prayer she started to tell her friends about Jesus. Before long Rachel had started her own group in her school. Every week she came back with stories of more people joining the group until eventually she was leading a group of fifteen children her age. God was definitely up to something, working through her. One day I sat with her to find out more about how her group was doing and to check that it was not simply a social group, but that she really was leading her friends to Jesus. I was looking for any weakness in her leadership so that I could help to develop her and encourage her in the work that she was doing. She started by telling me how she prayed for her cell each day and prepared things to teach them from the Bible. They were spending time in prayer together and worshiped God together each week and she ended each meeting by delivering a challenge for her friends to tackle in the week ahead. All in all she was doing a great job, leading her group at a very high standard. I was just about to encourage her when she carried on... “After the meeting some of the group come to me and share their problems and I pray with them.” I was thrilled by this clear indication that the group, most of whom she had led to Jesus herself, saw her as their spiritual leader. It was real confirmation that she was doing a great job. But before I could tell her that she kept on speaking: “Then next week I follow up with them to see if the problem is better. If it is, then we thank God because He has done a miracle. If not, then I pray again until it is.” By this time I was greatly moved. We always knew this eight-year old had a pastor’s heart for people and now, through her ministry, she was showing it. I felt gently rebuked for the times when I have failed to follow people up as I should due to the busyness of life. Here she was ministering to the flock God had given her better than me. The whole point of this conversation had been to develop her. Instead, I was being challenged. Once I had recovered my composure I went on to ask her more. “So when you follow this up with people, if God has done a miracle do you share this with the rest of the group?” Rachel looked at me and paused for a moment before she spoke. “It depends. I ask the person and see if they are happy for me to share with the rest of the group. If they are, then we tell them, but if not we don’t.” I was left speechless. The wisdom of God working through the life of an eight-year old never ceases to amaze

Without wanting to resort to slogans and clichés, I can tell you that ultimately there is an ending that is even bigger than pain and death, in the hope of the resurrection day to come. That won’t take away your sense of hurt, but might just give some perspective to the sad season that you find yourself walking through right now. In Christ, there is a guaranteed happy ending. Eventually.

We are supposed to live lives that imitate the life of Jesus. As He was anointed and appointed to heal the sick, raise the dead, and cast out demons through the power of the Holy Spirit, so are we. God has generously chosen us to continue the ministry of Jesus. He said in John chapter 14 that He would not leave us alone when He went back to heaven, but instead the Holy Spirit would come for everyone: I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you. John 14:18

When we worship together as a church, it is not to help us escape living in the real world, but to focus on the God who wants us to make a difference. Failure to do that means that we become irrelevant, salt that has lost its taste, and our worship becomes a tuneless din in God’s ears.

Another kidney punch is the accusation that the teaching isn’t deep enough. What exactly is ‘deep’ preaching? Does ‘deep’ mean that Tom Wright has been oft-quoted, that a grainy image of an ancient Mesopotamian tablet has been flashed up on PowerPoint, and that the sermon has been sprinkled with a few Greek words, other than kebab? Some Christians seem to think that deep teaching happens when they don’t understand what the speaker is talking about, as if their confusion is a sign that they are truly connecting with the transcendental. On the other hand, if a complicated idea is presented clearly, they are tempted to believe that the content is lightweight and the speaker is too. Thus, the better the teacher you are, the more likely you are to be accused of not being deep, because you’re gifted to make the complex accessible. There’s no way to win when that kind of attitude prevails.

Some churches are being vacated, not because people are abandoning God, but rather are looking for Him, and have given up hope of finding Him in what have become temples of the tedious. The exodus from church happens, not necessarily because of doctrine, but dullness.
